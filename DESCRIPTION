Description: A system for visualizing multivariate penguin data as schematic 
    penguin drawings. Physical measurements (bill length/depth, flipper length, 
    body mass) are mapped to visual features of penguin glyphs, while species 
    is encoded by color and sex by eye shape. Designed to work with the Palmer 
    Penguins dataset.
