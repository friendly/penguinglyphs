Drawing a glyph to represent a multivariate observation entails mapping the values of variables onto visual features of
the glyph. This is easy when the glyph is a simple geometric shape, as in Edgar Anderson's [-@Anderson:1957], use of
circular glyphs with rays whose angles and lengths could represent numerous variables.
